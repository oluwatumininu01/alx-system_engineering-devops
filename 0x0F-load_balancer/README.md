0x0F-load_balancer This repository contains the implementation of a load balancer, which distributes incoming network traffic across multiple servers to ensure optimal resource utilization and improve overall system performance. The load balancer is designed to handle high traffic volumes and maintain high availability for the application or service it is load balancing.

How it works The load balancer operates based on a predefined algorithm that determines how incoming requests are distributed among the available servers. The algorithm takes into account factors such as server health, current server load, and connection persistence. Here's a high-level overview of how the load balancer works:

Configuration: The load balancer is configured with information about the available servers, their IP addresses, and other relevant details.

Incoming Requests: When a client sends a request to the load balancer, it acts as an intermediary between the client and the servers.

Load Balancing Algorithm: The load balancer applies its load balancing algorithm to determine the most suitable server to handle the incoming request.

Request Forwarding: The load balancer forwards the client's request to the selected server, establishing a connection between the client and the server.

Response Handling: The server processes the request and sends the response back to the client through the load balancer.

Monitoring and Health Checks: The load balancer continuously monitors the health and performance of the servers. It may periodically perform health checks to verify that the servers are still available and able to handle requests.
