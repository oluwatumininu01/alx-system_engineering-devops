Networking Basics #0
This project is part of the DevOps curriculum and is designed to introduce the fundamentals of networking. The project has a duration of 48 hours, starting on May 3, 2023, at 5:00 AM, and ending on May 5, 2023, at 5:00 AM. An auto review will be launched at the deadline.

Learning Objectives
By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without the help of Google:

What is the OSI model, its organization, and how many layers it has
What is a LAN, its typical usage, and geographical size
What is a WAN, its typical usage, and geographical size
What is the internet, an IP address, and the two types of IP address
What is localhost and a subnet
Why IPv6 was created
What TCP/UDP are and the difference between them
What is a port, and memorize SSH, HTTP and HTTPS port numbers
What tool/protocol is often used to check if a device is connected to a network
Resources

Tasks
This project includes several tasks that cover different aspects of networking. Each task requires you to provide a specific answer or solution that aligns with the learning objectives of the project.

0. OSI model
   This task requires you to answer two multiple-choice questions about the OSI model.

Question 1: What is the OSI model?

Set of specifications that network hardware manufacturers must respect
The OSI model is a conceptual model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system without regard to their underlying internal structure and technology
The OSI model is a model that characterizes the communication functions of a telecommunication system with a strong regard for their underlying internal structure and technology
Question 2: How is the OSI model organized?

Alphabetically
From the lowest to the highest level
Randomly
Tasks 1-13
These tasks cover different aspects of networking, including LAN, WAN, internet, IP address, TCP/UDP, and ports. Each task requires you to provide a specific answer or solution that aligns with the learning objectives of the project.
